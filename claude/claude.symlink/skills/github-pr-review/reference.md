## User Verification Patterns

**CRITICAL**: After completing each comment/thread, you MUST pause and wait for explicit user approval before proceeding.

### Pattern 1: After Completing a Thread with Changes

After you've made changes, committed, and replied, provide this summary and pause:

```
## Summary of Work Completed

**Thread**: [link to PR comment]
**Author**: [reviewer name]
**Original Concern**: [brief description]

**Changes Made**:
- [file path]: [description of change]

**Commit**: [commit hash]

**Reply Posted**:
> [quote the reply you posted]

**GitHub Comment**: [link to the comment you replied to]

---

I've completed work on this thread. Please verify the changes and reply were appropriate before I move to the next thread.

[STOP - WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]
```

### Pattern 2: After Completing a Thread Without Changes (Won't Fix)

When you decide not to implement a suggestion:

```
## Summary of Work Completed

**Thread**: [link to PR comment]
**Author**: [reviewer name]
**Original Concern**: [brief description]

**Decision**: Not implementing this suggestion

**Reasoning**: [explanation of why]

**Reply Posted**:
> [quote the reply explaining reasoning]

---

I've responded to this thread with reasoning. Please verify this approach is appropriate before I move to the next thread.

[STOP - WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]
```

### Pattern 3: Asking for User Decision

When you're uncertain about a suggestion:

```
## Thread Analysis

**Thread**: [link to PR comment]
**Author**: [reviewer name]
**Concern**: [description]

**Current Code**:
```[language]
[relevant code snippet]
```

**Reviewer's Suggestion**: [what they want changed]

**My Analysis**: [your assessment]

**Options**:
1. Implement the suggestion as requested
2. Implement with modifications: [describe]
3. Decline with reasoning: [explain]

What would you like me to do with this comment?

[STOP - WAIT FOR USER DECISION]
```

### Pattern 4: User Approval Responses

After pausing, wait for responses like:
- ✅ "continue" / "yes" / "proceed" / "next" / "looks good"
- ✅ "go ahead" / "approved" / "ok" / "lgtm"
- ❌ "wait" / "hold on" / "let me check" / "not yet"
- ❌ "make this change first..." (requires additional work)

**Only continue to the next thread when you receive explicit approval.**

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't batch process**: Never handle multiple threads in one response
❌ **Don't assume approval**: Never continue without explicit user confirmation
❌ **Don't be vague**: Don't say "moving to next thread" without pausing
❌ **Don't skip summaries**: Always provide detailed summary before pausing

### Communication Templates

**When pausing after completing a thread:**
- "I've completed work on this thread. Please verify the changes and reply were appropriate before I move to the next thread."
- "Ready to move to the next comment? Please confirm."
- "Please review this work before I continue to the next thread."

**When waiting for decision:**
- "I need your input on this comment before proceeding. What would you like me to do?"
- "This suggestion requires a decision. Should I implement it, modify it, or decline it?"

**When acknowledging approval:**
- "Thanks! Moving to the next thread now."
- "Acknowledged. Proceeding with thread #2..."

```

**Example:**
```
After reviewing this suggestion, I believe the current implementation is appropriate because the error is already caught and logged at the caller level in main().

Adding redundant error handling here would increase code complexity without providing additional safety, as this function is only called from one location.

## Common Code Review Patterns

### Pattern: Null/Undefined Checks

**Concern**: Missing null checks, potential null pointer exceptions

**Analysis checklist:**
- Is the value guaranteed to be non-null by caller?
- Does the type system enforce non-nullability?
- Would adding a check be defensive or necessary?

**Fix approaches:**
- Add explicit null/undefined check
- Use optional chaining (`?.`)
- Add type guards or assertions
- Document assumptions

### Pattern: Error Handling

**Concern**: Uncaught exceptions, missing error handling

**Analysis checklist:**
- What errors can occur in this code path?
- Are they already handled upstream?
- Should they be caught here or propagated?
- Is the error message helpful for debugging?

**Fix approaches:**
- Add try-catch blocks
- Return error results instead of throwing
- Add proper error logging
- Validate inputs early

### Pattern: Performance Issues

**Concern**: Inefficient algorithms, unnecessary loops, redundant operations

**Analysis checklist:**
- What is the time complexity?
- Is this code on a hot path?
- Are there obvious optimizations?
- What is the data size in practice?

**Fix approaches:**
- Use more efficient data structures
- Cache computed results
- Reduce redundant operations
- Add early returns

### Pattern: Code Duplication

**Concern**: Duplicated logic, copy-pasted code

**Analysis checklist:**
- Is the duplication intentional?
- Will these code paths diverge in the future?
- Is abstraction worth the complexity?
- How many instances are duplicated?

**Fix approaches:**
- Extract common function/method
- Use composition or inheritance
- Create utility functions
- Use configuration over code

### Pattern: Security Vulnerabilities

**Concern**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication issues

**Analysis checklist:**
- Is user input properly sanitized?
- Are queries parameterized?
- Is output properly escaped?
- Are authentication/authorization checks in place?

**Fix approaches:**
- Use parameterized queries
- Sanitize and escape all user input
- Add authentication middleware
- Implement proper access controls

### Pattern: Missing Tests

**Concern**: Insufficient test coverage, missing edge cases

**Analysis checklist:**
- What are the critical paths?
- What edge cases exist?
- What can fail?
- Are error paths tested?

**Fix approaches:**
- Add unit tests for happy path
- Add tests for edge cases
- Add tests for error conditions
- Add integration tests if needed

## Thread Analysis Strategies

### Strategy 1: Chronological Review

Always process comments in chronological order:

```bash
# In jq, sort by createdAt
.comments.nodes | sort_by(.createdAt)
```

Identify:
1. **Original concern** (first comment)
2. **Author responses** (subsequent author comments)
3. **Reviewer clarifications** (subsequent reviewer comments)
4. **Current status** (latest actionable feedback)

### Strategy 2: Author vs. Reviewer Tracking

Track the conversation flow:

- **Reviewer comments**: What they're asking for
- **Author responses**: What's been tried or explained
- **Bot comments**: CI/CD results, automated suggestions

Focus on the latest **human reviewer** feedback, not bot comments.

### Strategy 3: Context Extraction

From thread data, extract:

- **File path**: `thread.path`
- **Line number**: `thread.line` or `thread.originalLine`
- **Diff hunk**: `comments[0].diffHunk`
- **Comment body**: `comments[].body`
- **URLs**: `comments[].url`

### Strategy 4: Actionability Assessment

Determine if the feedback is:

- **Actionable**: Clear request for change
- **Discussion**: Open-ended question or suggestion
- **Informational**: FYI, no action needed
- **Already addressed**: Fixed in later commits

## Git Workflow Patterns

### Pattern: Single Fix Commit

For single-file, focused fixes:

```bash
# Stage specific file
git add path/to/file.js

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix null check in processUser function

Addresses PR review comment about potential null pointer.
Adds explicit null check before accessing user.profile."

# Push to feature branch
git push
```

### Pattern: Multi-file Fix

For fixes spanning multiple files:

```bash
# Stage each file individually
git add src/utils/validator.js
git add src/models/user.js
git add tests/user.test.js

# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "Add input validation for user creation

Addresses PR review comment about missing validation.
- Added validateUserInput() utility function
- Updated User model to validate on creation
- Added tests for validation edge cases"

# Push to feature branch
git push
```

### Pattern: Get Latest Commit Hash

After committing:

```bash
# Get short commit hash
git rev-parse --short HEAD

# Get full commit hash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Use this hash in your reply message.

### Pattern: Check Current Branch

Before making changes:

```bash
# Verify you're on a feature branch, not main/master
git branch --show-current
```

Never commit directly to main/master.

## Error Handling

### Script Errors

If a script fails:

1. **Check the error message** - Scripts output errors to stderr
2. **Verify prerequisites** - Ensure `gh` and `jq` are installed
3. **Check authentication** - Run `gh auth status`
4. **Validate inputs** - Ensure URLs are in correct format

### Common Errors

#### "Error: Invalid GitHub PR URL format"

**Cause**: URL doesn't match expected pattern

**Fix**: Ensure URL is one of:
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#discussion_r456789`
- `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#r456789`

#### "Error: Could not find review thread"

**Cause**: Comment ID doesn't exist or is not in this PR

**Fix**:
- Verify the comment URL is correct
- Check if comment was deleted
- Ensure you're using the right PR number

#### "Error: GraphQL query failed"

**Cause**: GitHub API error, authentication issue, or rate limiting

**Fix**:
- Check `gh auth status`
- Verify network connectivity
- Check GitHub API rate limits
- Retry after a moment

### Recovery Strategies

#### If a thread was partially processed:

1. Check what was committed: `git log -1`
2. Check if reply was posted on GitHub
3. Continue from where you left off
4. Update todo list to reflect current state

#### If commit pushed but reply failed:

1. Get the commit hash: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
2. Manually retry the reply script
3. Or inform user to post reply manually

#### If reply posted but todo not updated:

1. Verify the work is complete on GitHub
2. Update todo list to mark as completed
3. Move to next thread

## Advanced Patterns

### Handling Complex Conversations

For threads with 5+ comments:

1. **Summarize the conversation arc** - What evolved?
2. **Identify resolution** - Was consensus reached?
3. **Check for scope creep** - Is the ask now different?
4. **Address the core issue** - What's the actual concern?

### Batching Related Fixes

If multiple comments address the same underlying issue:

1. **Identify the pattern** - Same root cause?
2. **Fix comprehensively** - Address all instances
3. **Reply to each thread** - With same commit hash
4. **Reference related threads** - Help reviewer see full picture

### Disagreeing Respectfully

If you believe a suggestion shouldn't be implemented:

1. **Acknowledge the concern** - Show you understand
2. **Explain your reasoning** - Why current approach is better
3. **Provide evidence** - Performance data, examples, docs
4. **Offer alternatives** - Different ways to address concern
5. **Invite discussion** - Keep it collaborative
